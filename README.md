# Spam Classification

This project aims to classify a set of messages into spam or not spam (also called ham) using a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm. 

The open-source data set is extracted from machine learning repository archives @ [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection). 

This interactive Python notebook walkthroughs the cross-industry standard data science practices ([CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)) utilized to create, test, and optimize a naive Bayes classification algorithm. 

This notebook section discusses the end-to-end methodology used to create this classifier.
